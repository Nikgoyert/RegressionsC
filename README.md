Regressions in C: 

Had this idea for a fun project while in grad school, will finish it! 

Simple concept, I want to write a program in C that will take a user's text file, 
and run an OLS regression based on user specified variables.  

CURRENT STATUS: 

-Program opens a user-specified text file. 
-Program reads the first line of the file and stores header variables. 

TO DO: 

-Major work that needs to be done is building the actual data structure that
can be manipulated to yield OLS results.  I have put a preliminary effor in which
is visible in the commented out 'build_row' function.  Needs much tinkering. 

-Once we have a matrix like data structure, the actual mathematics need to be
coded.
